# Pizza Sipari≈ü Analizi Projesi  üçï

# Technologies Used
- Microsoft SQL Server: For database management and data analysis.
- SQL: For data querying and analysis.


# Project Summary
In this project, I conducted in-depth data analysis of pizza orders using various techniques and rules in SQL. 
By effectively utilizing SQL functions such as JOIN, GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, and DATEPART, I was able to interpret the data and extract valuable insights.

During this analysis process, I uncovered critical information regarding the distribution of pizza orders, the most preferred ingredients,
and the highest-priced pizzas, which allowed me to observe trends within the industry. Specifically, by examining the impact of pizza sizes 
and ingredient preferences on order quantities, I gained significant insights into customer behavior.

The knowledge I acquired through this project has provided a valuable foundation for making strategic decisions in the marketing industry and enhancing
customer satisfaction. As a result of my analyses, I contributed to data-driven decision-making processes while also improving my SQL skills.

This experience has helped me develop a deeper understanding of data analysis and provided a strong foundation to apply in future projects.
Through the various tools and techniques offered by SQL, I seized the opportunity to explore the power of data and transform it into business strategies.

#  SQL Methods and Techniques Used
- Database Creation:
- CREATE DATABASE: This command is used to create a new database, allowing for the definition of a new data repository.
USE: This command activates the specified database, ensuring that subsequent operations are performed within that database.
- Data Retrieval:
SELECT: A fundamental statement for querying specific data from the database, allowing the selection of desired columns or all data.
JOIN: Combines multiple tables, enabling the integration of related data for more comprehensive data analysis.
- Aggregate Functions:
COUNT(): Returns the number of unique records in a specified column, helping to analyze the size of the dataset.
SUM(): Calculates the total of values in a specified column, serving as an essential tool in financial or quantitative data analysis.
- Data Grouping:
GROUP BY: Groups data based on a specific column, facilitating aggregate analysis, such as examining sales by categories.
ORDER BY: Used for sorting operations, allowing data to be presented in a specific order (ascending or descending).
- Window Functions:
RANK() OVER(): Assigns a rank to each item in the dataset based on a specific criterion, useful for competitive analysis.
SUM() OVER(): Computes cumulative totals, enabling the tracking of changes over time and facilitating trend analysis.
- Date Functions:
DATEPART(): Extracts a specific component (such as hour, day, or month) from date data, allowing for time-based analyses.
C- ommon Table Expressions (CTEs):
WITH: Creates a temporary result set, enhancing the readability and manageability of more complex queries.
String Functions:
CONCAT(): Combines strings of different data types, aiding in the creation of more meaningful data presentations.
CAST(): Converts data types, providing flexibility in analytical processes and maintaining data integrity.
