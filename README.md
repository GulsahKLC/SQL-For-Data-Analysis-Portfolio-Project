# Pizza Sipari≈ü Analizi Projesi  üçï

# Technologies Used
- Microsoft SQL Server: For database management and data analysis.
- SQL: For data querying and analysis.


# Project Summary
In this project, I conducted in-depth data analysis of pizza orders using various techniques and rules in SQL. 
By effectively utilizing SQL functions such as JOIN, GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, and DATEPART, I was able to interpret the data and extract valuable insights.

During this analysis process, I uncovered critical information regarding the distribution of pizza orders, the most preferred ingredients,
and the highest-priced pizzas, which allowed me to observe trends within the industry. Specifically, by examining the impact of pizza sizes 
and ingredient preferences on order quantities, I gained significant insights into customer behavior.

The knowledge I acquired through this project has provided a valuable foundation for making strategic decisions in the marketing industry and enhancing
customer satisfaction. As a result of my analyses, I contributed to data-driven decision-making processes while also improving my SQL skills.

This experience has helped me develop a deeper understanding of data analysis and provided a strong foundation to apply in future projects.
Through the various tools and techniques offered by SQL, I seized the opportunity to explore the power of data and transform it into business strategies.
